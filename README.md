## What we are building:
This project is a loan repayment calculator that will provide students with an interactive interface to help better plan their loan repayment over time.

We are going to incorporate the following topics:
* Authentication:  
    Users will have the option to make accounts to save their information. We will use authentication to make the accounts secure.
* Data Storage:  
    We will store users' information in a database so it is available when they sign out and sign back in.
* HTTP Application Server:  
    We will implement an HTTP server to communicate between the database and the client side application.
